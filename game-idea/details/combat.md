# Combat
- When units fight the fight is largely determined by the amount of units facing each other, but there is an aspect of randomness as well. this way you can sometimes have a lucky fight where 2 units defeat 3 units for example
- For the prototype phase, every henchman is equal. the only unit that's stronger is the mobster
- Surviving units after an attack will remain on the tile they fought on. every fight ends with either or both sides loosing all their units. there is no condition where both sides take losses but some remain alive. So surviving units protecting a store remain in the store and surviving attackers remain in the store as well until they're moved
