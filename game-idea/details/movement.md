# Movement
- Movement is restricted to adjacent tiles. Use A* algorithm to find paths
- The mobster can always move around freely on the map. but they can only capture stores that are adjacent to their existing stores
- Characters can't move diagonally (only up, down, left, right)
- Giving a unit new instructions should cancel old ones and move to the new location
