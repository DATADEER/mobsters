# AI
- I have no idea how to program the AI that controls the enemy mobsters, but this sounds like an exciting things to discover
- I definitely want difficulty levels at some point. but for the prototype it's a balanced enemy. I would also love to have AI's with different playstyles (defensive, expansive, nagging, mixed)
