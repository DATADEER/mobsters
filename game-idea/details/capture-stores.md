- capturing the store takes 10 seconds. the mobster needs to remain on the store for the duration of the process. otherwise the capture process restarts
- as soon as the mobster has captured the store, he can leave the store and the store will remain the players store until it is captured by someone else
- if the store isn't captured yet you need to bring a predictable amount of henchmen to clear the bodyguards of the store, so you can capture the store without much resistance.
- if the store is already captured, you need to first kill the henchmen in it. The twist is: You can't fully see how many henchmen are in the store. So you always have to decide. "am i sending a large group, to make sure i'm getting the store?" or "am i sending a small group, hoping they will be enough, but risk loosing them all"
- You can protect your store by leaving henchmen in that store to protect it. enemies trying to capture that store, first need to eliminate those henchmen before they can capture the store
