# Resource System
- businesses generate resources at a fixed interval. more if it's upgraded. if the store gets captured before the end of current loop of the interval, the payment goes to the new owner, even if the previous owner had started the loop
- For the prototype there is only one business type
- if a business is no longer connected to the hq, the player will not receive any money for that store until it's connected again. the money that was generated while the store was cut-off is lost
