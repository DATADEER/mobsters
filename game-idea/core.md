- the game has up to 4 players. whenever we say "you", it related to player 1. But all of these rules are true for all players
- all remaining players are controlled by the computer
- you with your single base tile 
- your mobster inhabits the base tile. he is a very strong unit. But if your mobster dies you loose the game.
- there are other tiles around you, each representing a business one can capture. you can only capture stores that are adjacent to your own stores or your base
- all the tiles around directly adjacent to your own tile are visible but grayed out, which indicates they don't yet belong to anyone
- other tiles on the map are covered by a fog of war, but it's clear they exist. Due to the fog of war you can't see who they belong to.
- if a tile has the color of one of the players in the game, the tile belongs to that player
- your task is to kill all other mobsters on the map
- you can gain more power, ability to move and money by by extorting or buying capturing stores on the map
    - most units can only move to tiles that are adjacent to your own. the mobster can move freely.
- every store gives you money. You can use money to get more henchmen or invest in the effectivity of your existing stores.
    - You always need to weigh your options.
        - if you keep your empire small: It's easy to protect but you can't eliminate the enemy because you can't reach them. You also give your enemy more space to expand, which is generally cheaper than upgrading stores
        - if you expand too quickly: you're easy to attack. enemies might destroy your walking paths, decrease your money earning opportunities. But on the flipside your get closer to your ultimate goal of killing the enemy mobster
    - Investing in your businesses effectivity gets progressively expensive with every upgrade
- how to capture stores: you capture stores by sending enough henchmen to that store to kill the henchmen in it and then capture it by putting your mobster on the store.
- The game is realtime. Hiring henchmen takes time, moving henchmen takes a time, capturing takes time, upgrading businesses takes time.
- The game uses the simples graphics possible. Low pixel count, abstract pixel art, a henchmen is a square, the mobster is a bigger square, every store is a large bordered rectangular shape and so on.
