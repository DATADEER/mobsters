- you start at the center of the screen with your base as a single tile
- your mobster inhabits the base tile. he is a very strong unit. But if your mobster dies you loose the game.
- there are other tiles around you, each representing a business one can capture. you can only capture stores that are adjacent to your own stores or your base
- all the tiles around directly adjacent to your own tile are visible but grayed out, which indicates they don't yet belong to anyone
- other tiles on the map are covered by a fog of war, but it's clear they exist. Due to the fog of war you can't see who they belong to.
- if a tile has the color of one of the players in the game, the tile belongs to that player
- your task is to kill all other mobsters on the map
- you can gain more power, ability to move and money by by extorting or buying capturing stores on the map
    - most units can only move to tiles that are adjacent to your own. the mobster can move freely.
- every store gives you money. You can use money to get more henchmen or invest in the effectivity of your existing stores.
    - You always need to weigh your options.
        - if you keep your empire small: It's easy to protect but you can't eliminate the enemy because you can't reach them. You also give your enemy more space to expand, which is generally cheaper than upgrading stores
        - if you expand too quickly: you're easy to attack. enemies might destroy your walking paths, decrease your money earning opportunities. But on the flipside your get closer to your ultimate goal of killing the enemy mobster
    - Investing in your businesses effectivity gets progressively expensive with every upgrade
- how to capture stores: you capture stores by sending enough henchmen to that store to kill the henchmen in it and then capture it by putting your mobster on the store.
    - if the store isn't captured yet you need to bring a predictable amount of henchmen to clear the bodyguards of the store, so you can capture the store without much resistance.
    - if the store is already captured, you need to first kill the henchmen in it. The twist is: You can't fully see how many henchmen are in the store. So you always have to decide. "am i sending a large group, to make sure i'm getting the store?" or "am i sending a small group, hoping they will be enough, but risk loosing them all"
    - You can protect your store by leaving henchmen in that store to protect it. enemies trying to capture that store, first need to eliminate those henchmen before they can capture the store
- The game is realtime. Hiring henchmen takes time, moving henchmen takes a time, capturing takes time, upgrading businesses takes time.
- The game uses the simples graphics possible. Low pixel count, abstract pixel art, a henchmen is a square, the mobster is a bigger square, every store is a large bordered rectangular shape and so on.
