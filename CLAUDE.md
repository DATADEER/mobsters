* if you're done play afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Blow.aiff
* use GDScript compatible with Godot 4.x
* always check if what you build matches with the game idea from the /game-idea folder. These markdown files contain the ground truth. If the implementation doesn't match these files, tell me and I will update them. don't update them yourself 
* prefer flexibility over performance, we can still optimise performance later
* cleanup after implementing a feature. don't leave unsued code behind you
